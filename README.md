Basic CSS style sheets for new designs.

Disclaimer
----------

As this is 2013, and I am not in the business of creating commercial web sites,
these styles are not intended to be backwards compatible, or even play nice
with browsers that are a little behind the HTML5/CSS3 curve.  They work in
whatever browser I happen to be using, and that's all I need for this.

That being said, I don't use any proprietary or non-standard selectors or
rules.  Therefore, pages rendered with these styles should at least not look
_bad_ in a browser that doesn't support all the features I'm using.

base.css
--------

The boilerplate styles that get the basic rendering, fonts, and colors into a
reasonable state.

layout.css
----------

Provides a solid starting point for building an adaptive, multi-column layout.
It can be used as-is, but is probably more of a working example of how to
build your own.

ui.css
------

Changes some of the form controls, and adds some miscellaneous things that I
consider helpful for "interactive" pages.

hz.css
------

Contains a few styles that I like to use for general-purpose, application-style
layouts.

\_test.css
---------

Only used for testing (draws borders around layout elements).
